/* Check if a given string starts with a given sub-string.  If so, return 1 and, if afterp is not
 NULL, set *afterp to point to the character immediately following the substring.  Otherwise
 return 0.
 This function is used to parse HTTP headers and responses, which are typically not
 nul-terminated, but are held in a buffer which has an associated length.  To avoid this function
 running past the end of the buffer, the caller must ensure that the buffer contains a sub-string
 that is not part of the sub-string being sought, eg, "\r\n\r\n" as detected by
 http_header_complete().  This guarantees that this function will return nonzero before running
 past the end of the buffer.
