/*
  We use 256bit Curve25519 addresses in the overlay mesh.  This means we have very large
  addresses to send around the place on a regular basis, which is bad.

  We allow addresses to be shortened to save bandwidth, especially for low-bandwidth links.

  For this purpose we have special address prefixes 0x00 - 0x0f which are not allowed to
  occur in unabbreviated addresses.
  
  0x00      = reserved
  0x01-0x02 = one to two byte address by index.
  0x03      = same as last address.
  0x04      = address matches sender (not currently implemented).
  0x05      = address by prefix of three bytes. 
  0x06      = address by prefix of seven bytes. 
  0x07      = address by prefix of eleven bytes.
  0x08      = full address followed by one-byte index allocation.
  0x09-0x0b = same as 0x05-0x07, but assign single byte index.
  0x0c      = reserved.
  0x0d      = same as 0x07, but assign two byte index.
  0x0e      = full address followed by two-byte index allocation.
  0x0f      = broadcast link-local.
  
  However, in this implementation we not include support for the two-byte 
  index code, as it requires 64Kx32=2MB storage, which is too much to ask
  of a mesh potato or a cheap smart phone.

  All indexed abbreviations may reference a token which is used to keep
  track of the epoch of the abbreviation table.  

  This allows us to maintain multiple abbreviation tables at the same time, so 
  that neighbours we have not spoken to for some time will not be so easily 
  confused, as any one epoch will remain valid for some time after it has 
  ceased to be ammended.

  This also allows us to effectively have multiple 256-entry pages, which will
  be more efficient than using a 16-bit index table in most instances, especially
  since we have the flexibility to reorder frames in an ensemble to minimise the
  total length.

  One table is maintained for all interfaces, as we may have neighbours who are
  reachable via multiple interfaces.  It also helps to minimise memory usage.

  A cache of recently seen addresses is also desirable for conclusively resolving
  abbreviated addresses. Failure will allow the birthday paradox to cause us problems
  and also allow an attack based on searching for private keys that yield colliding
  public key prefixes.  This would allow an attacker to mess with the routing and
  divert the traffic of other nodes to themselves.  Thus some cache or similar policy
  is strongly recommended if a node is going to accept address prefixes, especially if 
  it accepts the shorter prefixes.  Seven and eleven byte prefixes should be reasonably
  resistant to this attack. 

  There is no reason why the address abbreviation table cannot be used as the cache,
  excepting for the question of efficiency, as a naive implementation would require
  a linear search.  However, adding a simple index table can mitigate this, and thus
  presents as a sensible solution.  

  If a node receives a packet with an abbreviation that it cannot resolve an
  abbreviation can ask for clarification, including indicating if it does 
  not support the abbreviation mode specified.

  Abbreviations are link-local, but clarifications will always be requested by
  attempting to contact the abbreviator via normal mesh routing rules.

  We need to take some care so as to allow other crypto-systems, and thus storing the
  crypto-system ID byte, although we still limit addresses to 256 bits, so we always need
  no more than 33 bytes.  In any case, indicating the crypto system is not the problem of
  this section, as we are just concerned with abbreviating and expanding the addresses.

  (A simple solution to the multiple crypto-system problem is to have the receiver try each
  known crypto system when decoding a frame, and remember which addresses use which system.
  Probably a reasonable solution for now.)

  To decode abbreviations supplied by other nodes we need to try to replicate a copy of
  their abbreviation table.  This is where things get memory intensive (about 8KB per node).
  However, we only need the table of one-hop neighbours, and it is reasonable to have a
  constrained set of such tables, with a random replacement algorithm.  This allows the 
  structure to be scaled to accomodate varying memory sizes of devices. 
  
  Very memory constrained devices may elect to cache individual entries rather than tables
  of individual nodes, but we haven't implemented that here.

  If we send only a prefix, then we need to be careful to make sure that receivers
  get some chance to learn the full address if they need it. The question is whether
  abbreviation clarification is more or less efficient than sometimes sending the 
  full address.  Given that we already have need for the clarification process, let's
  go that way, and change the policy later if appropriate.

  Having had said this, on mono-directional links there is a problem with using the
  various abbreviation schemes that require state.  And this is that the receiver has
  no way to issue a please-explain.  In these situations, we need to fall-back to at
  most using the abbreviations only most of the time, and still sending the full-address
  some of the time, so that even without a feedback look to ask for explanations the
  receiver should synchronise with us fairly well.

  Also, we haven't implemented index-based lookup on the receiver side, so we need to fix
  that or disable it on the sender side.
